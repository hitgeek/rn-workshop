## Layout

```
Flexbox works the same way in React Native as it does in CSS on the web, with a few exceptions. The defaults are different, with flexDirection defaulting to column instead of row, and the flex parameter only supporting a single number.
```

a combination of flex, flexDirection, justifyContent and alignItems can achieve most layouts

* flex: 
- When flex is a positive number, it makes the component flexible and it will be sized proportional to its flex value. So a component with flex set to 2 will take twice the space as a component with flex set to 1.
- When flex is 0, the component is "not flexible", component sized based on width & height

* flexDirection: determines "primary axis"
 - row || column
 - default is column

* justifyContent: determines childrens layout "along primary axis"
 - flex-start, center, flex-end, space-around, and space-between
 - default is flex-start

* alignItems: determines childrens layout "along secondary axis"
- flex-start, center, flex-end, and stretch
- default is flex-start


* trying out debugging in chrome
