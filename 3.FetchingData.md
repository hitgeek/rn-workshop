## Getting Data from API and working with state

* react data
```
There are two types of data that control a component: props and state. props are set by the parent and they are fixed throughout the lifetime of a component. For data that is going to change, we have to use state.
```

```
In general, you should initialize state in the constructor, and then call setState when you want to change it.
```

* fetch API
  * pass in url and optionally Data
    `fetch(url, data)`
  * asynchronous operation, returns a promis
    fetch().then(handler).then(anotherHandler)
